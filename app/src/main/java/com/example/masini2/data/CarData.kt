An early model fetched \$38 million at Bonhams' Quail Lodge auction at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance few years ago. If that's too pricey, know that any 1960s Prancing Horse with a V12 engine is worthy of making the list.", R.drawable.ferrari_gto),

Six years later, it set the record for the world's fastest production car, at 242 mph. \"The McLaren F1 was Formula One legend Gordon Murray's high-tech supercar answer to Porsche and Ferrari,\" Hagerty says. \"And it didn't just exceed the standards they established, it obliterated them. Driving an F1 is a sublime ballet of shocking power, braking, and control.\" McLaren only built 64 of these, but fortunately, it just put up for sale chassis #69, the 60th model built.",R.drawable.mclaren_f1),

As the first direct fuel injection series production car, the SL 300 could travel at an eye-popping 160 miles per hour. \"Nobody expected something like that from Mercedes,\" says Constantin von Kageneck, a specialist in classic car marketing at the Mercedes-Benz Classic Center in Irvine, CA.

Besides the new look, the C2 Corvette was a bit lighter and handled far better than its predecessors. While some nice stylistic changes would be made in the coming years, there’s something about being first.", R.drawable.corvette_sting_ray_1963))
